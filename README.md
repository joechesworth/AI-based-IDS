# AI-based-IDS
This is an AI based IDS that focuses on testing the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms on the same dataset, namely the UNSW-NB15 dataset
The machine learnig algorithms are the Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network

--GUIDE ON HOW TO RUN THE CODE--

It is intended to run in jupyter notebook to help highlight each section but can be run in any python IDE
All 5 CSV files will need to be located within the same file as the IDS code and will need to be named exactly as follows:

- UNSW-NB15_1.csv
- UNSW-NB15_2.csv
- UNSW-NB15_3.csv
- UNSW-NB15_4.csv
- UNSW-features.csv

You will need the following python libraries to run the code:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Tensorflow

These are all clearly stated at the start of the code
Once all the libraries are installed just select Run All Cells in the notebook and leave it until it has completed
